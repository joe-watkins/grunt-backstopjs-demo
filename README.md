# grunt-backstopjs demo

This repo consists of a demo for running grunt-backstopjs. I've elected to include `bower_components` and `node_modules` so you can just fire up the testing easily with no setup.

Available tasks:

`$ grunt backstop:setup`

`$ grunt backstop:reference`

`$ grunt backstop:test`

Vist the [plugin's page ](https://github.com/ddluc/grunt-backstop) to learn more.
